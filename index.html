           Most people today don't care about their privacy online. 
           A majority of people today would say "if you have nothing 
           to hide why care about your privacy online". This argument 
           is reprehensible because people do not realize the stretch and 
           bounds of big tech and government what is okay today on the internet
           not might be okay in the future. Big tech is constantly switching guidelines 
           and censoring speech and other forms of media. When browsing the websites for free, your data is the product.

        <h2>You will own nothing!</h2>
        <p>
        The way we consume media now is excellent and convenient. Most people consume media by 
        paying for various subscriptions like Netflix, HBO, etc. While this form of mass media is convenient
        and easy, problems arise because media on these platforms are constantly being pulled or taken down. Don't 
        take my word for it: in 2020, Netflix removed an episode from the popular series "The Office"  due to an episode 
        not fitting modern-day sensitivity standards. This is just one of many examples of how streaming websites can take
        away censored media. As physical media becomes a thing of the past, the ability to own and control your media has long been in the past.
